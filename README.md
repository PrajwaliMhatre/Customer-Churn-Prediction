# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a business or service, typically by discontinuing the use of its products or services. It is a crucial metric for businesses as it measures the rate at which customers leave or "churn out." High churn rates can signify issues such as dissatisfaction, competition, or changing customer needs. Reducing customer churn is often a strategic goal for companies, as retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Analyzing the reasons behind customer churn and implementing strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty are essential for sustaining a healthy and successful business
